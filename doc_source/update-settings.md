## Update your AWS analysis coverage in DevOps Guru<a name="update-coverage"></a>

 You can update which AWS resources in your account DevOps Guru analyzes\. The resources that are analyzed make up your DevOps Guru coverage boundary\. You have three boundary coverage options\. 
+ Choose to have DevOps Guru analyze all supported resources in your account\. 
+ Specify specific resources by choosing AWS CloudFormation stacks that define those resources\. If you do this, DevOps Guru analyzes every resource specified in the stacks you choose\. If a resource in your account is not defined by a stack you choose, it is not analyzed\. 
+ Specify to have no resources analyzed so that you stop incurring charges from resource analyzation\.
**Note**  
If you update your coverage to stop analyzing resources, you might continue to incur minor charges if you review existing insights generated by DevOps Guru in the past\. These charges are associated with API calls used to retrieve and display insight information\. For more information, see [Amazon DevOps Guru pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/pricing/)\.

 DevOps Guru supports all resources that are associated with supported services\. For more information about the supported services and resources, see [Amazon DevOps Guru pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/pricing/)\.

1. Choose **Settings** in the navigation pane\.

1. Choose one of the following coverage options\. 
   + Choose **Analyze all AWS resources in the current account** if you want DevOps Guru to analyze all supported resources in your AWS account\. If you choose this option, your account is your resource analysis coverage boundary\.

     1. If you have not enabled any stacks, in **CloudFormation stacks**, choose **Manage analysis coverage**\.

## Update your notifications in DevOps Guru<a name="update-notifications"></a>

Set up Amazon Simple Notification Service topics that are used to notify you about important Amazon DevOps Guru events\. You can choose from a list of topic names that already exist in your AWS account, enter the name for a new topic that DevOps Guru creates in your account, or enter the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of an existing topic in any AWS account in your Region\. If you specify the ARN of a topic that is not in your account, you must grant permission for DevOps Guru to access that topic by adding an IAM policy to it\. For more information, see [Permissions for cross account Amazon SNS topics](sns-required-permissions.md)\. You can specify up to two topics\. 

 DevOps Guru sends notifications for the following events\. 
+  A new insight is created\.

You can enable the creation of an OpsItem for each new insight in AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter\. OpsCenter is a centralized system where you can view, investigate, and review operational work items \(OpsItems\)\. The OpsItems for your insights can help you manage work that addresses the anomalous behavior that triggered the creation of each insight\. For more information, see [AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter.html) and [Working with OpsItem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-working-with-OpsItems.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.

You are charged for OpsItems created in your account\. For more information, see [AWS Systems Manager pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing/)\.
