# DevOps Guru concepts<a name="concepts"></a>

The following concepts are important for understanding how Amazon DevOps Guru works\.

**Topics**
+ [Anomaly](#concept-anomaly)
+ [Insight](#concept-insight)
+ [Metrics and operational events](#metrics-and-operational-events)
+ [Recommendations](#recommendation)

## Anomaly<a name="concept-anomaly"></a>

An anomaly represents one or more related metrics detected by DevOps Guru that are unexpected or unusual\. DevOps Guru generates anomalies by using machine learning to analyze metrics and operational data that are related to your AWS resources\. You specify the AWS resources that you want analyzed when you set up Amazon DevOps Guru\. For more information, see [Setting up Amazon DevOps Guru](setting-up.md)\. 

## Insight<a name="concept-insight"></a>

An insight is a collection of anomalies that are created during the analysis of the AWS resources you specify when you set up DevOps Guru\. Each insight contains observations, recommendations, and analytical data you can use to improve your operational performance\. There are two types of insights: 
+ *Reactive*: A reactive insight identifies anomalous behavior as it occurs\. It contains anomalies with recommendations, related metrics, and events to help you understand and address the issues now\. 
+ *Proactive*: A proactive insight lets you know about anomalous behavior before it occurs\. It contains anomalies with recommendations to help you address the issues before they are predicted to happen\. 

## Metrics and operational events<a name="metrics-and-operational-events"></a>

The anomalies that make up an insight are generated by analyzing the metrics returned by Amazon CloudWatch and operational events emitted by your AWS resources\. You can view the metrics and the operational events that create an insight to help you better understand issues in your application\. 

## Recommendations<a name="recommendation"></a>

Each insight provides recommendations with suggestions to help you improve the performance of your application\. The recommendation includes the following: 
+ A description of the recommendation actions to address the anomalies that comprise the insight\. 
+ A list of the analyzed metrics in which DevOps Guru found anomalous behavior\. Each metric includes the name of the AWS CloudFormation stack that generated the resource associated with the metrics, the resource's name, and the name of the AWS service associated with the resource\. 
+ A list of the events that are related to the anomalous metrics associated with the insight\. Each related event contains the name of the AWS CloudFormation stack that generated the resource associated with the event, the name of the resource that generated the event, and the name of the AWS service associated with the event\.
