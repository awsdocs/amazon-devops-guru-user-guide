# Logging and monitoring DevOps Guru<a name="monitoring-overview"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of DevOps Guru and your other AWS solutions\. AWS provides the following monitoring tools to watch DevOps Guru, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when appropriate:
+ *Amazon CloudWatch* monitors your AWS resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time\. You can collect and track metrics, create customized dashboards, and set alarms that notify you or take actions when a specified metric reaches a threshold that you specify\. For example, you can have CloudWatch track how many insights are created in your account and your Amazon DevOps Guru usage\. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)\.
+ *AWS CloudTrail* captures DevOps Guru API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. For more information, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)\.
