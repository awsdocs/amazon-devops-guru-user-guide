## Turning on Performance Insights for your Amazon Aurora DB instances<a name="working-with-rds.enabling.pi"></a>

For DevOps Guru for RDS to analyze anomalies on a DB instance, make sure that Performance Insights is turned on\. If Performance Insights isn't turned on for a DB instance, DevOps Guru for RDS notifies you in the following places:

Dashboard  
If you view insights by resource type, the **RDS** tile alerts you that Performance Insights isn't turned on\. Choose the link to turn on Performance Insights in the Amazon RDS console\.

Insights  
In the **Recommendations** section at the bottom of the page, choose **Enable Amazon RDS Performance Insights**\.

Settings  
In the **Service: Amazon RDS** section, choose the link to turn on Performance Insights in the Amazon RDS console\.

For more information, see [Enabling and disabling Performance Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.Enabling.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*\.

## Configuring access policies for DevOps Guru for RDS<a name="working-with-rds.enabling.policy"></a>

For your IAM user or role to access DevOps Guru for RDS, it must have either of the following policies:
+ The AWS managed policy `AmazonRDSFullAccess`
+ A customer managed policy that allows the following actions:
  + `pi:GetResourceMetrics`
  + `pi:DescribeDimensionKeys`
  + `pi:GetDimensionKeyDetails`

For more information, see [Configuring access policies for Performance Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.access-control.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*\.

## Adding Amazon Aurora DB instances to your DevOps Guru coverage<a name="working-with-rds.enabling.cf"></a>

By default, DevOps Guru analyzes all supported AWS resources in your AWS Region and AWS account\. You can also choose which Amazon Aurora DB instances in your Region and account are covered\. You can specify DB instances in the following ways:
+ Specify AWS CloudFormation stacks for DevOps Guru for RDS\.

  For more information, see [Use AWS CloudFormation stacks to identify resources in your DevOps Guru applications](working-with-cfn-stacks.md)\.
+ Tag your Amazon Aurora resources\.

  A *tag* is a custom attribute label that you assign to an AWS resource\. Use tags to identify the AWS resources that make up your application\. You can then filter your insights by tag to view only those created by your application\. To view only insights generated by the Amazon RDS resources in your application, add a value such as `Devops-guru-rds` to your Amazon RDS resource tags\. For more information, see [Use tags to identify resources in your DevOps Guru applications](working-with-resource-tags.md)\.
