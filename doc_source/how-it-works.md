# How does DevOps Guru work?<a name="how-it-works"></a>

The DevOps Guru workflow begins when you configure its coverage and notifications\. After you set up DevOps Guru, it starts to analyze your operational data\. When it detects anomalous behavior, it creates an insight that contains recommendations and lists of metrics and events that are related to the issue\. For each insight, DevOps Guru notifies you\. If you enabled AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter, an OpsItem is created so you can use Systems Manager OpsCenter to track and manage addressing your insights\. Each insight contains recommendations, metrics, and events related to anomalous behavior\. Use information in an insight to help you understand and address the anomalous behavior\.

See [High level DevOps Guru workflow](high-level-workflow.md) for more detail about the three high\-level workflow steps\. See [Detailed DevOps Guru workflow](detailed-workflow.md) to learn about the more detailed DevOps Guru workflow, including how it interacts with other AWS services\.
