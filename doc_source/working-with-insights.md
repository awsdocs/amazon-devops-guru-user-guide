# Working with insights in DevOps Guru<a name="working-with-insights"></a>

An *insight* is generated by Amazon DevOps Guru when it detects anomalous behavior in your operational applications\. DevOps Guru analyzes the metrics, events, and more in the AWS resources you specified when you set up DevOps Guru\. Each insight contains one or more recommendation for you to take to mitigate the issue\. It also contains a list of the metrics and a list of the events that were used to identify the unusual behavior\. 

There are two insight types\.
+ *Reactive* insights have recommendations you can take to address issues that are happening now\. 
+ *Proactive* insights have recommendations that address issues that DevOps Guru predicts will occur in the future\.
